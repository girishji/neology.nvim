# OOMA 

A mono-color colortheme for neovim suitable for coding without distraction. It uses font shading and font variation to achieve contrast. I found that colors do not convey any additional information, especially if used inconsistently. It is written in Lua with Treesitter support. It is best used with fonts with true italic support, like IBM Plex Mono, Victor Mono, Jetbrains Mono, Operator Mono, etc. These fonts have distinct style for italics, unlike faux italics where font is simply slanted.
